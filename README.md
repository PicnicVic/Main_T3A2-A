## **Picnic Vic Description**

> _Nothing is better than a picnic in Vic!_

#### **Client:**

Parks Victoria - Victorian State Government

#### **Purpose:**

In a post Covid world we now know more than ever that we need to connect with our friends and family, outdoors in the _real world_. We need to utilise our green open spaces to enrich our lives.<br />
To meet calls and pressure that local councils and the State Government aren't providing enough green space, Parks Victoria are creating a new inner city park database. For small and large parks alike!<br />
The **Picnic Vic** app provides detailed park amenity information to help facilitate a family picnic to a skate park hangout.<br /><br />
**_A park is nothing without a picnic and nothing is better than a picnic in Vic!_** <br /><br />
Want to reach peak Vic picnic? üç∑ + üßÄ = üß∫ <br/>
The Picnic Vic app have teamed up with Victorian Wine and Cheese producers to pair your local park with local picnic produce. <br />
_It doesn't get much Gouda than that._
